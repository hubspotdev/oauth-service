# HubSpot Public App OAuth Service

## What this project does

This OAuth Service repository is a stand-alone service for handling the OAuth 2.0 processes needed for a HubSpot integration.

## Why is this project useful:

This project demonstrates how to:

 - Set up the scopes needed for an integration

 - Create a PostgreSQL database to store OAuth refresh and access tokens

 - Go through the initial OAuth installation

 - Generate the initial access token, and refresh access tokens after they expire

## URLs:

 - **GET /install**: Displays a clickable link to the OAuth authentication URL for users to connect the app to HubSpot. This should be the first step a new user or client performs to initiate the OAuth 2.0 authorization process.

 - **GET /oauth-callback**: Handles the redirect from the HubSpot OAuth authorization process. Processes the authorization code to obtain an access token and refresh token for the HubSpot user.

  - **GET /api/get-install-url**: Returns the OAuth authentication URL as a plain text string. Can be used by other services to get the install URL.

  - **GET /api/get-token**: Returns the token for a given local customerId. Requires a `customerId=` query parameter.

## Getting started with the project:

### Using Docker (Recommended):

1. Clone the repo

2. If you haven't done so yet, please make sure to instal [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) on your local environment.

3. Create the `.env` file with these entries (see examples in the [.env.example](./.env.example) file)

 - `DATABASE_URL`: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/oauth_service`
 - `CLIENT_ID`: The client ID from the HubSpot public app
 - `CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret from the HubSpot public app
 - `SCOPES`: A space separated list of scopes needed by the HubSpot public app

3. In your [HubSpot public app](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/creating-an-app), add `localhost:3001/oauth-callback` as a redirect URL

4. Start the application:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3001`

### Manual Setup (Alternative):

1. Download and install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), make sure it's running, and create an empty database.

2. Clone the repo

3. Create the `.env` file with these entries:
 - `DATABASE_URL`: The local url to the postgres database (e.g. `postgresql://{username}:{password}@localhost:5432/{database name}`)
 - `CLIENT_ID`: The client ID from the HubSpot public app
 - `CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret from the HubSpot public app
 - `SCOPES`: A space separated scopes needed by the HubSpot public app

4. Run `npm install` to install the required Node packages.

5. Run `npm run db-init` to create the necessary tables in PostgreSQL

6. Run `npm run dev` to start the server

## Docker Commands

```bash
# Start the services
docker-compose up --build

# Stop the services
docker-compose down

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Reset database (will delete all data)
docker-compose down -v
```
